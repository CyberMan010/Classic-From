# Classic-From

## index.html - The main HTML structure that links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
## styles.css - Contains all styling for the form.
## formConfig.js - Contains just the JSON configuration for the form. This is where you can:

# Add new form fields
**Modify existing fields**
**Change form titles and messages**
**Set validation rules**


## script.js - Contains the JavaScript functionality that:

# Dynamically generates the form fields from the configuration
- Handles form validation
- Manages form submission



# How to Add New Fields
__To add new form fields in the future, simply modify the formConfig.js file by adding new objects to the__ __fields array. I've included a commented example of how to add a username field.__
__Advantages of This Split Structure__

## Separation of Concerns: Each file has a specific purpose, making the code easier to maintain.
__Better Organization: Easier to find and modify specific parts of the code.__
__Improved Reusability: The configuration file can be easily modified or replaced for different forms.__
__Easier Collaboration: Different team members can work on different files simultaneously.__
